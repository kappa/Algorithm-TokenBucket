Algorithm::TokenBucket version 0.21
===============================

Token bucket algorithm is a flexible way of imposing a rate limit
against a stream of items. It is also very easy to combine several
rate-limiters in an C<AND> or C<OR> fashion.

Each bucket has a memory footprint of constant size because the
algorithm is based on statistics. This was my main motivation to
implement it. Other rate limiters on CPAN (Schedule::RateLimit
and Algorithm::FloodControl) keep track of I<ALL> incoming
events in memory and are able therefore to be strictly exact.
